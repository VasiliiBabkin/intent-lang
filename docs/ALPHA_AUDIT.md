# First public Alpha engineering audit / Инженерный аудит

Date: 2026-10-29. Baseline: [`08fd020`](https://github.com/VasiliiBabkin/sedrava/commit/08fd020dfd111238aea619c9e0b6684f2be8b25e), actual `main` at checkout. Work branch: `alpha/0.9.0a1-engineering`. Candidate version remains **0.9.0a1** (unreleased). No PyPI upload, release tag or public release is implied by this document.

## Audit coverage and architecture

Reviewed both parsers, CLI, shared AST/evaluator, Web/Android generators, packaging, all existing tests/workflows, README/roadmap/0.9 status, reference app and Android acceptance findings, plus recent PRs [#6](https://github.com/VasiliiBabkin/sedrava/pull/6), [#7](https://github.com/VasiliiBabkin/sedrava/pull/7), [#8](https://github.com/VasiliiBabkin/sedrava/pull/8).

The working core remains in place. `sedrava_core.py` is the 0.9 typed AST/interpreter; Web and `android_codegen_v03.py` consume it. `sedrava.py` and `android_codegen.py` retain historical subset compatibility; the latter supplies the compatible Gradle scaffold using a fixed harmless source. No application semantics pass through the old parser in the current CLI. Retaining these modules avoids breaking existing users/tests; they are documented as compatibility tools, not the normative 0.9 API. No architecture rewrite or 0.10 feature expansion was needed.

Actual features: int32/bool state, checked +/−/*, pure derives, typed sequential actions/if/else, final invariants, embedded independent tests, one screen, numeric input, static text/value/button/conditional text, accepted-state persistence in generated UIs. Strings as state, clocks, lists, toggles, cards, navigation and editor self-hosting remain future work. Static labels are not string fields. See [normative reference](LANGUAGE_0_9.md).

## Defects found and corrected

| Finding | Correction and regression evidence |
| --- | --- |
| `run` absent from CLI | Deterministic JSON interpreter with action sequence, failure codes and paths-with-spaces test |
| Minimum int32 literal rejected while oversized literals survived in unused expressions | Normalize signed minimum and validate every literal; boundary regression tests |
| Invalid initial derives could compile and crash UI startup | Validate all initial derives, even without rules |
| Python evaluated unused derives differently from generated runtimes | Check all derives after each assignment and before final/input/restored acceptance; 720-step Python/Node suite |
| Web/Android action arithmetic could escape callbacks | Atomic rejection and visible error; Chromium verifies no unhandled exception or partial update |
| Saved values restored without invariant validation; Android wrong-type prefs could throw | Per-field fallback plus whole-snapshot semantic validation; browser corruption tests and JVM validation tests |
| Kotlin `$` labels interpolated; names collided with generated locals | Escape dollar signs, prefix all generated user variables; regression tests |
| App names could terminate an HTML script | Script-safe JSON encoding; real-browser injection regression |
| JS prototype-like derived identifiers failed | Null-prototype derived maps and computed action keys; browser boundary test |
| Duplicate screens, indentation tabs, derive expansion and deep blocks insufficiently guarded | Reject duplicate screens/tabs, bound expansion/nesting and reserve literal/keyword state names |
| Activity recreation discarded accepted transient state | `rememberSaveable`; generation verified, new device rotation check remains unperformed |
| Source archives omitted guides/examples/scripts | Explicit manifest, stronger archive audit and clean-install tests |

## Measured local results

- Baseline: **78 tests passed**.
- Updated Python unit/integration/conformance/example suite: **87 tests passed**, no skips in the local run. Node differential suite includes 720 deterministic steps over 9 UI/boundary programs in addition to prior Workflow/rejection suites.
- Actual Chromium through Playwright: **7 tests passed**. All UI examples launch; input ranges/relational constraints, correction, empty draft, derived overflow, atomic action overflow, persistence/reload, malformed saved data, script injection and prototype/minimum-integer cases covered. Browser traces are emitted under `build/browser`.
- Android: full JDK 17.0.17 (Temurin), Gradle 8.11.1, SDK platform 35, build-tools 35.0.0 installed during this pass. Initial build using the environment's Java 21 JRE failed because `javac` was missing; this is a toolchain issue, not a passed gate. Final APK/JVM/Lint results are recorded below when completed.
- `adb devices`: **no attached devices**. `/dev/kvm`: **absent**. No local emulator, installation, UI instrumentation, logcat/rotation or new physical-device acceptance is claimed.
- Historical manual Android 16 results remain unchanged in [ANDROID_09_ACCEPTANCE.md](ANDROID_09_ACCEPTANCE.md). They refer to a previous binary and are not attributed to these new changes.
- Distribution, clean-checkout and CI final results are recorded below when completed. No claim of exhaustive semantic equivalence or complete transitive CVE coverage.

## Security, dependencies and licenses

No Python runtime dependencies, source `eval`/`exec`, shell execution from application source, telemetry, accounts, advertising or cloud runtime added. Inputs are bounded and typed. Generated source manifests declare no permissions; actual merged permissions must be inspected with SDK tools. No secrets belong in source or local storage. See [security review and audit boundaries](SECURITY.md) and [known limitations](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md). Direct Android dependencies are pinned; a complete transitive advisory/SBOM audit and bit-identical APK reproducibility remain unclaimed.

## Release decision

A reviewable PR and reproducible candidate are the objective. A public release is allowed only after the exact final commit passes mandatory CI/package/Web/Android gates. No version change is warranted: this is the first unpublished 0.9 alpha and the fixes repair its intended contract. Newly stricter rejection affects malformed/unsafe candidates, not a published stable language.

For next steps use the [publication checklist](RELEASE_NOTES_0_9_0a1.md), [build guide](BUILD.md) and [0.10 architecture](PLAN_0_10_UI.md). Complete device revalidation remains explicitly separate from successful builds.

## Completed build/package checks

- First local reference APK and Android Lint build: **PASS**, JDK 17/Gradle 8.11.1, 46 tasks executed. A second clean build using the final generator plus JVM tests is also required and recorded in the follow-up results.
- Wheel and sdist: **built successfully**, `twine check` passed, archive/license/metadata audit passed. Clean virtual environment installs `sedrava 0.9.0a1` with no runtime dependency packages.
- Current documentation checker validates 11 guide files and their local links.

The first implementation commit is [`1565170`](https://github.com/VasiliiBabkin/sedrava/commit/15651705cdfc64afb8382affb3dd98b05901b198). Final PR/CI artifact evidence is added after the corresponding run exists; no placeholder URL is evidence of success.

## Final local Android result and first CI feedback

- **PASS:** clean reference build, `assembleDebug`, `lintDebug`, `testDebugUnitTest`; 52 tasks executed, 2 JVM tests, 0 failures/errors/skips. JVM tests execute generated snapshot/input invariant validation, not Compose UI callbacks.
- **PASS:** separate Countdown Android APK build (35 tasks), without modifying generated application code.
- **PASS:** SDK `apksigner verify` (v2 signature), `aapt dump badging`, `aapt dump permissions`. The merged APK has only AndroidX's own `org.sedrava.generated.DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION` (signature protection), no Internet/storage/camera/location or other dangerous permission. Lint: 0 errors, 5 `UseKtx` style warnings and 3 informational boxing suggestions.
- **PASS:** separate clean Git worktree at `2323256`: unit/conformance/example suite, documentation links, wheel/sdist build and metadata/archive audit; wheel installation and CLI check/test/run/both targets from outside the source directory, including output paths with spaces. Source-archive installation also checked.
- The first expanded CI run exposed an existing test-only Python 3.10 incompatibility (`tomllib` is standard only from 3.11). Fixed with the test-only `tomli` extra/backport, without raising the supported runtime Python version or skipping the test. CI now disables matrix fail-fast and checks out the exact PR head for alpha/reference gates.
- PR: [#9](https://github.com/VasiliiBabkin/sedrava/pull/9). First CI run: [40890956733](https://github.com/VasiliiBabkin/sedrava/actions/runs/40890956733) (not green; Python 3.10 test import failure). Final passing runs must be used for publication.
